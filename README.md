# Trees: Implementation and runtime

To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:

- Implement a binary search tree.

> *Note: If downloading the assessment files to your local machine, make sure you're running Node v18 before you run* `npm install`.
>
> 1.  *Check which version you are running:* `node -v`
> 2.  *If needed, change the version to v18:* `nvm use v18`
>
> _For additional help, review the "Learn your tools: Visual Studio Code" lesson in the "Welcome" module._

## Instructions

Your goal for this assessment is to get the tests to pass.

To do so, you will be modifying the existing `BinarySearchTree` class to implement a binary search tree with lookup, insert, and delete capabilities.

### Existing files

| File path                 | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/main.js`             | Contains some example uses of the `BinarySearchTree` class.                                                             |
| `src/BinarySearchTree.js` | Contains the definition of the `BinarySearchTree` class. The `constructor()` method has already been completed for you. |

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment.

In the `src/BinarySeachTree.js` file:

1.  Complete the `insert()` method to insert a node into the BST. The method should accept a key and a value as its arguments.

2.  Complete the `find()` method, which should accept a key as its argument and return the value for the given key in the BST. Throw an `Error()` with a string error message if the node is not found in the BST.

3.  Complete the `remove()` method to delete a node with a given key in the BST. Throw an `Error()` with a string error message if the node to be removed is not found in the BST.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
